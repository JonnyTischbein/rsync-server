# rsync-server
Bash script to sync a folder with a remote one. I used it to develop on my local maschine with IDE and make changes on server valid without pushing and pulling git.

The script will connects via `ssh` and uses `rsync` to copy files (if necessary).

If no ssh key is used a password prompt will be needed to fill before syncing.

##HowTo
1. Download the script
2. Set Config Variables in script (see below)
3. Make it runnable `chmod +x sync-server.sh`
